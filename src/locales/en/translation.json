While visual resources are effective, turning them into useful study tools like flashcards and quizzes takes a lot of time and effort. That's where KnowVa began – as a solution built by students, for students.",
    "storyText2": "We realized the struggle of manually converting image-based materials into review content. So, we created KnowVa to make this process smarter, faster, and more intuitive. By leveraging modern technologies, KnowVa extracts knowledge from learning images and helps users generate flashcards and quizzes effortlessly.",

With KnowVa, we're not just building a tool. We're reimagining how students learn from visuals."
